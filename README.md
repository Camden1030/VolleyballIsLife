# VolleyballIsLife
I describe to you why volleyball is a great sport and how it has brought me many great friends and many great experiences. It is a fun and competitive sport that pushes you to your physical and mental limits. There are many variations of volleyball including regular court volleyball, beach volleyball, chinese 9 man volleyball, and grass volleyball.
